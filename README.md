# RateEverything
A website built using the MERN stack to rate literally ANYTHING

make sure you have mongodb running locally, i still dont know if itll be code specific for user, but mongo + [these dependencies](https://github.com/Krish-Arun/RateEverything/blob/main/package_installations.md) should be enough
